# Introduction #
Modern day computer users work on several machines everyday (think work and home). It is common to have copies of the same file on those machines.
Some users resort to manually copying files from one system to another using a portable storage device. This is repeated every time when there are changes. Add to that, the difficulty of keeping track of the latest version of the file. Finally, do that for all the files you have.
Thus, it is not hard to imagine why it takes quite a bit of effort to manually keep files in sync on users’ workstations. This is where file synchronisation tools like Sync Butler come in handy. It does all this work for you automatically!

_Ah... so that is what it is does_

## What is File Synchronisation ##
As it was briefly described above, file synchronisation software automates the process of keeping your files the same on your systems. They just do it in a slightly different manner.
We at Sync Butler strive to make it really easy and painless for the user to sync their files. Sync Butler resolves most differences in the two folders without prompting you for a decision. For those file conflicts that Sync Butler cannot resolve, you simply have to tick the box you wish to copy the file from.
At the end of the process, you will have two identical folders which were initially out-of-sync.

## Common Terms ##
  * **Partnership**: Tells Sync Butler which (two) folders to keep in sync.
  * **1st Folder (or Folder 1)**: The first folder of the partnership, usually the computer you are working on now.
  * **2nd Folder (or Folder 2)**: The second folder of the partnership, usually a portable storage device.
  * **Conflicts**: Occurs when changes have been made to the same file on the two folders. Sync Butler cannot determine which copy is a more useful revision.

## Usage Scenarios ##
Here are some uses of File Synchronisation

### Example Scenario 1 ###
You produce presentations on the office’s desktop and present them using your laptop. Sync Butler automatically copies over your new presentation materials to your laptop when you sync the two machines using a thumb drive.

### Example Scenario 2 ###
You work on your laptop daily and keep your desktop at home for your gaming needs. Using your portable hard disk drive as the intermediate storage device, Sync Butler automatically copies your new project files on your laptop to your desktop for backup and reference.
Get the most out of Sync Butler by running the software just before you start or end your computing sessions!
