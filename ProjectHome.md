# What is File Synchronisation? #
Take at look at this Wiki, it should explain it!

[File Synchronisation; Explained!](FileSynchronisation_Explained.md)

# Current Features #

We work hard to enhance **Sync Butler** on a daily basis. The following features are currently available:
  * Regular File Synchronisation
  * Favourite Files Synchronisation (named **Sync Butler, _Sync_!**)

Other not-so-obvious features that we thought were cool enough to mention are:
  * Automatic detection of changes in drive letters
  * Intuitive minimalist graphical user interface

**Sync Butler** prides itself on being the most intuitive file synchronisation assistant in the market. We, the development team, are always ready to listen to your views and suggestions on how to make Sync Butler that much more intuitive and usable. Please feel free to drop us a message anytime or add an issue to our issue tracker.

# Sync Butler, _Sync_! #
While the tradition forms of file synchronisation keeps specified files in sync, **Sync Butler, _Sync!_**, is adaptive and automatically picks up files the user has created recently. It then copies them to a user’s specified portable storage.

## Sync Butler, _Sync_? ##
It is not unusual for users to forget and leave behind their half completed work on one machine only to realise they need it later on elsewhere. This is a bother because users cannot continue to work on the file somewhere else.

This is where **Sync Butler, _Sync!_** comes in. When users synchronise their usual folders, Sync Butler, Sync!, will take the liberty of copying the recently used and newly created folders on to the user’s portable storage device.

Thus, users will no longer have to worry when they need to access files that they were working on other systems.

# System Requirements #

We have tested **Sync Butler** extensively on Windows Vista (SP2) and Windows 7 (on both 32- and 64-bit). However, **Sync Butler** should run on Windows XP (SP3) and above, with the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installed. In addition, **Sync Butler** requires that the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service is running. This service is normally running by default, and is used by **Sync Butler** to detect your storage devices.

[Click here](http://www.microsoft.com/Net/Download.aspx) to download the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 from Microsoft's website.

**Sync Butler** should work with any USB portable storage device, such as portable hard disks that are connected to your computer via USB cable, and thumb drives.

If you encounter a problem while using Sync Butler, please inform us and include the version of Windows you are using, together with any other information you think might be relevant.
