  # Root Path
    # Means the part of directory path that do not change for a Left/Right folder. For example, Left: `C:\Nom\Ate\`, Right: `D:\Ated\` are root paths in a partnership. The Full Path may change to `C:\Nom\Ate\Yummy\Eatz.txt` but the root path of that folder in this partnership is still `C:\Nom\Ate\`. See Full Path for more information.
  # Full Path
    # Means the full path to a folder or a file. Includes the Drive letter.
  # Relative Path
    # The relative path from the root path to the file or folder
  # Entity Path
    # A _symbolic_ reference to a file/folder without the root path. It is essentially the relative path plus some info on whether it is a file or folder. Note that the keys in the checksum dictionary are just partnership name concatenated with the entity path.
  # WindowsFile
    # This has been defined as a partnership between two SAME files but in different location. Much like our Micro Partnership. (Thus checking is done to make sure this is so).
  # MRU
    # This means `Most Recently Used`. In this context, it refers to the recently used files of the user in a Windows system (XP/Vista/7). When it is referred to in an user context, it is described as favourties.
